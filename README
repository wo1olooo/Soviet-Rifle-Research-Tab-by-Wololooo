This is a dependency mod that provides a standalone Soviet-themed research tree for RimWorld.
It does not add any weapons itself â€” instead, it serves as a required framework for Soviet firearm mods that use its research structure.

ðŸ”§ What This Mod Does
Adds a custom Soviet Armory research tab

Provides research projects for:

Soviet Assault Rifles

Semi-Automatic Rifles

Sniper Rifles

Light Machine Guns

Enables Soviet weapon mods to use consistent, lore-friendly research paths

Fully RimWorld-lore integrated (pre-Fall tech rediscovered on the Rim)

This mod is required by any Soviet weapon mods created by Wololooo.
It does not add any guns or items on its own.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies & Use
This mod is intended to be used as a dependency for other weapon mods.
It must be loaded before any Soviet gun mods that rely on it.

ðŸ’¡ Example Use Cases
A mod that adds the AKM, SKS, or AS-44 will list this mod as a requirement.

That weapon will appear only after researching the relevant Soviet program from this mod.

âœ… Compatibility
RimWorld 1.5 / 1.6+

XML-only, no C# code or Harmony patches

Safe to add to existing saves (removal may break research trees)

ðŸ›  Technical Details
Adds a new research tab: Soviet Armory

Each project uses lore-rich, RimWorld-style descriptions

Built for modular weapon integration
