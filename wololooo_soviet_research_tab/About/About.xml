  <description>A curated collection of Cold War-era and WWII Soviet rifles — researched, rediscovered, and rebuilt on the Rim.

This mod adds a lore-rich, dedicated research tab for Soviet firearms, from experimental prototypes like the AVS-36 and AS-44 to legends like the AKM and SKS. Each weapon includes unique research, historical context, — rebuilt from corrupted schematics, derelict databanks, and stubborn survivor ingenuity.

Whether you’re a scavenger seeking old-world firepower or a warlord chasing legacy, this mod lets you walk the Rim armed with the forgotten steel of humanity’s violent cradle.

Crafted with obsessive detail by Wololooo.</description>
